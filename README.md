# 5 Lives-arcade-game
===============================

### Description
- This is based off of an old arcade game called Frogger. This is the 3rd project for my Udacity Front-end Nano-Degree. This game is created with Object Oriented JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and the class.js.

- The point of the game is to get to the river without hitting the bug. Don't let the bugs touch you or you will have to start over.

- It was a great experience making this game and I hope you enjoy playing it.

### How to play
To play this game please visit https://brownmagnus.github.io/5-Lives-arcade-game/.

- Use the arrow keys to move the player safely to water.
- Once you get to the water, you will win that level.
- Once you get to the water safely, you will get a reward.
- Beware of the bugs!:
- On the next level your player's outfit will change.
- Play Again and share.

### Running on local computer
- Download or clone the repository.
- Open index.html to the browser.

### Contributing
- Udacity provided the starter code which included the HTML5 Canvas (resource.js and engine.js) and most of the images. The Udacity rubric has a list of all the minimum requirements to complete the project.

- I referenced this Udacity HTML5 Canvas Course for adding the images (Player and Enemy) and to change the player character after every turn.

- I got more insight from  FEND Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone with Ryan Boris (@RyanB), Core Concept review and Matthew Cranford review.

### Future Updates
Add stones randomly to the path
Add key and star to for the player to collect before getting to the water

## *Have Fun!*
